  <p>Hello Kothi! I know you are doing good. I guess I'm more excited than you! I never knew that our bond would shine so bright! Happy it does... Wow, I can't believe it's your birthday already! It feels like we just met yesterday, but you've quickly become such a huge part of my life. You know, it's crazy how someone can enter our life and make it so much better in such a short time. You've done exactly that! From all the laughs we've shared to the fun times and even the occasional silly arguments, every moment with you has been awesome. You're not just a friend; you're my brother from another mother. Your energy, your spirit, and all those little quirks make you so amazing. Today is all about you, so let's make it epic! I hope your day is filled with all the things you loveâ€”fun, laughter, and maybe a bit of cake. You deserve nothing but the best, and I can't wait to see what this next year brings for you.

    Let me talk about how you celebrated my 23rd birthday. The day was just wow! I could see my little brother being proud of his sister and introducing her to everyone he knew. Thank you for making me feel so special Puta. I screw with you, and nevertheless, you do it to me too, but never think of staying away from me. I can't lose you... Just be my little human.
    
    
    Keep being your incredible self. Remember, no matter what, I've got your back. Let's create more awesome memories together and keep this fun ride going!
